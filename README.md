# Frontend Mentor - FAQ accordion card

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thank you for taking the time to review this front-end coding challenge.

For this challenge, I followed a YouTube tutorial by Seer Studio [Seer Studio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLZGpEHgOO8&t=1513s) to learn how to implement an accordion function using JavaScript. Since I am new to JavaScript, the tutorial was helpful in teaching me the necessary skills. Moving forward, I plan to explore more advanced topics and experiment with different techniques for creating an accordion function.

Alongside learning about the accordion element, I also gained knowledge about positioning elements using the "position: relative" property. This included understanding how to position an image relative to its parent container and how to place an object at a specific point on the page using the "transform: translate" property. Additionally, I learned how to adjust the image size uniformly and make it responsive to different screen sizes.
